    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/2 cup blueberries</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate small mixing bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and melted butter.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chocolate chips and blueberries.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Once hot, lightly grease the surface with cooking spray or butter.</li>
        <li>Scoop about 1/4 cup of the pancake batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, about 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the pancakes are cooked through.</li>
        <li>Serve the pancakes hot, topped with whipped cream or your favorite syrup, if desired.</li>
      </ol>
