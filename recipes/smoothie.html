    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A strawberry smoothie is a refreshing and healthy drink made by blending together fresh or frozen strawberries, milk, yogurt, and ice. It has a bright pink color and a sweet, fruity flavor that is perfect for a quick breakfast or afternoon pick-me-up. You can customize your smoothie by adding other ingredients such as bananas, spinach, or protein powder to give it a boost of nutrition. Enjoy your strawberry smoothie chilled, garnished with a few extra strawberries on top.</p>
